# Framework for writing macros that resyntax errors.

# This code uses terminology that is slightly non-standard from the
# point of view of traditional macro systems.  Specifically:
#
# - a "macro" is an object that may transform an expression to a
#   "syntax" object.  Spiritually:
#
#     type Macro = Expression -> Maybe Syntax
#
# - a "syntax" is an object that can emit a macroexpanded expression,
#   and implements an isomorphism between indexes on the expanded and
#   unexpanded versions of the expression.  Spiritually:
#
#     type Syntax = (Expression, Index -> Index, Index -> Index)
#
# - an "index" is a path through an expression that indicates a
#   subexpression of interest (used for error reporting).
#   Spiritually:
#
#     type Index = Expression -> Expression
#
#   but they are represented explicitly, and transformed by syntaxs.
#
# Note that there is no notional separation between "macroexpand-1"
# and "macroexpand" (to use vocabulary from Common Lisp): the "syntax"
# object produced by one invocation of a "macro" is responsible for
# producing a fully macroexpanded expression.  This is accomplished by
# recursively invoking macroexpansion on subexpressions.
#
# Given that, macroexpansion proceeds simply by trying all known
# macros in order, using the result of the first that produces
# something -- see the top-level function `expand`.
