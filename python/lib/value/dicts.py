"""Programmatically construct literal Venture values and unannotated Venture abstract syntax.

If you are writing a parser for a VentureScript sublanguage, see
`venture.parser.ast` for annotating the abstract syntax tree with the
location information the parser expects.

The main elements of constructing bare abstract syntax are

- `symbol` or `sym` for variables

- `app` for combining forms, whose components are abstract syntax

- the other functions (`number`, `boolean`, etc) for literals

Shortcuts for `quote`, `quasiquote`, and `unquote` are provided as
conveniences, since those forms occur often in programmatically
constructed expressions.
