"""A vaguely QuickCheck-inspired randomized testing framework for
properties about Venture.

The main entry point is checkTypedProperty (unlike in QuickCheck, the
type to be tested must be passed in explicitly).

Currently limited to synthesizing only VentureValues (as used by the
Lite backend), not objects of other types.

There are currently no facilities for automatically searching for
smaller counter-examples, as there are in QuickCheck.  This would be a
good next point for improvement.

There are also no good facilities for automatically checking whether a
property fails stochastically or deterministically, or combinators for
deciding whether "sporadic fail" should be treated as "fail" or
"pass"."""

  Will repeatedly call the property with:
  1. A random object matching the given type in the first position
  2. All the additional given positional and keyword arguments in
     subsequent positions.

  If the property completes successfully it is taken to have passed.
  If the property raises ArgumentsNotAppropriate, that test is ignored.
  - This amounts to refining the distribution on possible inputs by
    rejection sampling.
  If too many tests are thrown out, the test is taken as a skip
    (because the distribution on random inputs is not precise enough).
  If the property raises SkipTest, the test is aborted as a skip.
  If the property raises any other exception, it is taken to have
    failed, and the offending generated argument is communicated as a
    counter-example.
