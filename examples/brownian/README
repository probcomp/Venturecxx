This is an example of several inference schemes operating on
a brownian motion model.

Interesting properties:
- Custom state visualization showing inference operating.
- Presented at the PPAML PI meeting in July 2014, and reused for the
  NIPS 2014 prob prog workshop as part of the abstract on gradients.
- Annoying to test mechanically due to visual+video nature, and
  heavy dependency on pygame.
- Hasn't been used or tested since 2014, probably somewhat bit-rotten,
  and de-facto abandoned.
