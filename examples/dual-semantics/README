trickiness-*.vnts are three models that were used for the
VentureScript poster at the 2014 probabilistic programming workshop.

The purpose they serve is to illustrate the difference between the
"concrete" and the "ideal" semantics of VentureScript programs, or
more practically, that if you want good answers you have to ask for
inference (and the answers you get depend on the inference you ask
for).
