Aggregated "master" list of projects, compiled over the first two
weeks of February 2016.

- Capability acquisition projects
  - iVenture notebooks
    - Prereq: Solve the problems associated with versioning iPython
      notebooks (possibly by not relying on iPython)
    - Ditto testing them
    - Ditto maintaining them (at least at the level of examples)
    - Resource: venture-transcript
    - What are use cases, user stories, etc?  I will have a hard time
      without dogfooding this.
  - Tensorflow integration.
    - I have doubts: Feras gave tensorflow a bad review, and after
      VenStan I have somewhat soured on integrations.
  - vkm said: "Help Anthony successfully replace the Venture SP
    interface with his version of it."
    - Have been talking to Anthony, he doesn't seem to "be done", but
      maybe victory should be declared.
  - vkm said: "After, figure out how to really demo Stan in Venture".
  - vkm said: "Support Feras/Marco for making a console for Venture+BayesDB"
  - Implement distributed particle sets.
    - Could go through the recursive nested particles project, as
      `resample_distributed`.
    - #276 (distributed resample algorithm) will be more important for
      jobs big enough to use more than one machine to hold particles
      (unless they are all independent).
    - #396 (parallel execution is lockstep) will also be more important
      for such jobs, especially if cross-machine communication is
      involved.
    - Some notes and candidate user stories of sorts in
      doc/axch-dev-thrust-menu.org under "Project: Design a good
      experiment runner" and under "Project: Get cloud infrastructure"
    - REE makes this less urgent
    - After #566 (recursive per-particle inference programs), might not
      even be all that hard.
- Capability completion projects
  - Inference programming for real.  The plan, in order:
    - #566 (Recursive per-particle inference programs)
      - Kills off or much eases all of
        - #396 (non-lockstep parallel execution)
        - #228 (parallel custom Markov chains)
        - #227 (tutorial's custom markov chain failed horribly)
        - #563 (is a model one estimate or many?)
        - #564 (replicates of SMC runs)
        - #271 (confusing stochastic errors in multiparticle programs)
        - #565 (modeling directives in `for_each_particle`)
        - Plausible per-particle random choices
        - #519 (likelihood_weighting in the inference language)
    - #501 (assessable inference actions) to make `on_subproblem` or any
      kind of random-site M-H work
      - Enables writing `mh` and simple custom proposals in the
        inference language correctly
    - #199 part 1 (multicallable local posterior function)
    - #199 part 2 (deterministic local posterior function)
      - Enables writing slice sampling in the inference language
    - #199 part 3 (gradient of local posterior function)
      - Enables writing HMC in the inference language
    - #376 (export inference compounds to Python)
      - Enables plugging in to third-party tools for inference or
        optimization (L-BFGS, any standalone HMC implementations)
    - There is an unfiled "#199 part 4": If, e.g., L-BFGS deals
      gracefully with hard edges, those could perhaps be exposed to it
      in a reasonable way as well.
  - Smoother Python integration: Venture should be happy to consume and
    produce Python functions.
    - Python callables should smoothly work as inference actions (functions?)
    - Python callables should smoothly work as likelihood-free SPs
      - With smooth annotations for refinement, e.g. determinism
    - Inference actions should smoothly work as Python callables
    - Can I get (untraced) model SPs (or compounds!?) to work as Python
      callables?
    - And, some version of the detach/regen cycle should be callable
      repeatedly!
    - This would be much helped by a good default value conversion
      between venture values and Python values.
      - Can be overridden with explicit type annotations
      - Hence, need not be 1-1 or invertible; just do the right thing
        most of the time
    - #378 (collect and callback flexibility)
    - Would this subsume `call_back`?
  - HMC for real: We can do work to actually give Lite robust
    gradients for ascent, Hamiltonian, etc.  Related tickets:
    - #389 (test end-to-end gradients), #199 (expose regen)
    - #386 (consider replacing AD)
    - #383 (gradients through uncollapsed makers)
    - #388 (gradient through stochastic requests)
    - #387 (interface of gradientOfSimulate is wrong)
    - #385 (finish writing gradients)
    - #384 (boundary condition problem)
    - #82 (look into Stan's math library)
  - Review/redesign visualizations.
    - plotf hasn't dramatically taken off within the group
      - clunky to use
      - is it flexible enough?
      - can we collect data more smoothly? are there better plot types
        to be had? do we need a better plotting architecture, e.g. for
        distribution? do we need to iron bugs out of it (like
        overlapping histograms)? do we just need better documentation?
        can we do "probabilistic assertions" that use plots as evidence
        of success or failure (presumably p-p plots)? are there goodies
        to be had from interactivity, like a "add more points to this
        plot" button?
    - More possible features: compositing as a dimension (for
      different particles?); animation as a dimension (for the sweep
      count?); facting as a dimension (for whatever).
    - Have more notes in doc/axch-dev-thrust-menu.org under
      "Notes on plotting features"
  - Revisit the scaffold annotator called `draw_subproblem`.  It
    seems somewhat useful but less than optimally useful
    - partly because it doesn't say that it's showing all the nodes of
      each type that occur under a subexpression
    - partly because it doesn't obviously give the total scaffold size
    - partly because there isn't a version that gives only the immediate
      nodes in each subexpression
    - partly because it doesn't display the dependencies the way
      `draw_scaffold` does.
    - However, `draw_scaffold` is completely useless because it is not
      tied to the source code.  Can we make a better instance of both?
  + Reproducibility: Venture programs should be deterministic given a
    fixed seed, for reproducibility of results. (#138)
- Performance projects
  - Asymptotic performance assessment: We should make it easy to
    evaluate asymptotic behavior of Venture programs, and expand our
    suite of test programs.
    - We have some anecdotal indications that asymptotic performance is
      not actually on par with hand-written samplers (mostly around LDA,
      but I am currently not sure why).
    - Specific problem: calling simulate even when the SP will be
      observed can be poor if simulate is more expensive than logDensity
      - The dirichlet categoricals are somewhat smart about efficient
        repeated sampling and assessing with the same weights.
        - Only in Lite, not Puma.
    - There may be other lurking problems; our tests are paltry and
      ill-motivated
  - Performance measurement: We should make it very easy to time and
    profile Venture programs, and collect suites of test problems and
    of microbenchmarks whereby performance improvements can be
    measured.  (Notes in doc/axch-dev-thrust-menu.org under
    "Project: Collect a suite of performance test problems" and
    "Project: Start a suite of micro-benchmarks").
  - Vectorization: Write vectorized versions of all the built-in
    stochastic procedures.
    - Where the fit is good, vectorization drastically improves runtime
      and memory use.
    - Can use Stan, numpy, or Matlab for design inspiration.
  - Just-in-time partial evaluator: Can improve performance by JIT
    compiling the scaffold into regen, to save on interpreting it when
    propsals are repeated.
    - Do I have notes for this somewhere?
    - Anthony has some experiments on a branch.
    - May be worth ~2x by itself; big wins possible from this enabling
      compiler optimization on the result.
  - Assertion architecture. (2.c in the PRD)
    - e.g., "if I expect some Gaussian, fit the best one and draw it;
      also compute goodness-of-fit statistic"
      - idea courtesy William Cushing at the prob prog workshop
    - Not unrelated to inspection, collection, and visualization
  - Profile-driven optimization
    - Notes in doc/axch-dev-thrust-menu.org under "Activity: More
      profile-driven optimization"
- Testing projects
  - First step is to write the plan (#549).
    - Alex did something related and interesting on the BayesDB side
      - https://github.com/probcomp/bayeslite/pull/398/files
  - SP integrity: Should test that simulators agree with log
    densities, as a first step in a broad arc of SP integrity
    testing. (#155)
    - Some notes on that in doc/axch-dev-thrust-menu.org under
      "Activity: More testing", but most of those notes are in the old
      Asana instance (including useful record of which invariants are
      already being tested mechanically).
  - Test suite architecture rethink.
    - e.g., "assert this is supposed to asymptotically approach that
      -- do some compute -- did it?"; etc
    - inference quality testing of e.g. the tutorial is not unrelated
      to this
    - Not unrelated to the assertion architecture
- Demos I could probably write
  - DPM of logistic a la Yutian (using gradients and applying to UCI
    Iris dataset was recommended)
  - Could probably elevate crosscat.vnt, lda.vnt, hmm.vnt to demo
    status
  - Taylor drafted a web demo of Ulli's GP structure discovery
  - Finish cp1/slam-core.vnt in light of untraced inference
    - Old effort estimate: "1 day?"; but that context has been lost
    - Some notes in doc/axch-dev-thrust-menu.org under
      "Project: Resurrect and polish Venture-on-top SLAM"
- Papers
  - VentureScript paper, which I take to mean roughly "here is what our
    system can do".
    - Can use the "Venture manifesto" email I wrote to Chad
      Scherrer as a component
      - Subject was '"release candidate" slides'
  - HMC paper, which I take to mean roughly "we implemented HMC for
    general programs thus and so".
    - Old notes in doc/axch-dev-thrust-menu.org under "Paper:
      HMC in Venture"
  - Venture implementation paper: "here's what a trace is and why, here's
    how that supports standard methods, etc".
    - Sort of a replacement to "the Venture paper" on the arXiv.
  - Metaprob paper?  Don't know what this is supposed to be any more.
    - Old notes in doc/axch-dev-thrust-menu.org under "Paper:
      Notes (early 2015) on Metaprob"
  - Publication activity: Make camera-ready versions of the
    abstracts we presented at NIPS 2014
    - Still waiting for reviewer feedback from Dan Roy
    - Notes in doc/axch-dev-thrust-menu.org under "Paper: Notes
      (late 2014) on camera-readying the probprog NIPS abstracts"
- "Github milestone" type projects
  - Language polish for the GP paper (shouldn't be too long)
  - #570 (Surface-level design push).
  - The non-probability measure project: doc/on-non-probability-measures.md
    - First steps are easy and non-controversial.
  - A serious push on the "Software Health" label.
  - System simplification label
  - User-reported bugs label
  - Better testing label
  - Specific large bugs, like #295 (double macroexpand)
  - #380 (interactively more samples) was on my old list as a project
  - Make (sure) our existing parallelism (is) robust.
    - Success condition: The whole test suite runs with
      resample-parallel inserted into the default inference program.
    - Possible underwater stone: SPs that don't serialize properly
- Documentation / Teaching:
  - Self-study document: Ship a standalone document we can give
    interested people to learn Venture
    - Exchangeable coupling chapter (with discrete models?)
    - Maybe LDA chapter
    - Fuller reference manual
  - Foreign SP authoring documentation: Actually write (finish) the
    foreign SP author's guide (is this blocked on Anthony's work now?)
    - Notes in doc/axch-dev-thrust-menu.org under "Project:
      Finish the Foreign SP Author's guide (notes from 4/20/15)"
- Project: Get software process more under control
  - Issue #48 (mechanically test all supported artifacts)
    (entails #50, #52, #53)
  - Issue #172 (Gain confidence that our dependency version bounds are
    correct)
  - Maybe automatic nightly builds of release
    tarball+tutorial+reference (maybe even publish them to our CSAIL
    web space?  The latter would need a Kerberos principal for
    Jenkins)
  - Do we want to actually resurrect the challenge problem solutions,
    either as such or as example Venture programs?
    - Notes on how we wanted to enhance them at the time are in the
      ppaml-cps repository.
  - Clean github repos
    - can we merge venture-papers-2013 into venture-documents?
      - it's presumably just the Venture paper, nothing else?
      - ditto mitpcp-papers, NIPS2013Vision, nips-probprog-2014-abstracts/
    - can we merge website-venture into probcomp-website?
    - resuscitate VentureBenchmarksAndTests and merge into Venturecxx?
      - just study what was being tested and toss it?
- There is more stuff in doc/axch-dev-thrust-menu.org
  - 13 of those entries are linked from here; others are
    additional.
- There may be more stuff in the old Asana instance
