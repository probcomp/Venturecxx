Third-party software:
- backend/new_cxx/inc/Eigen
- external/ (plex, lemonade)
- My Scheme libraries, as externals in backend/v1-pre-scm
  (testing, adaptive-plot, pattern-case)
- silva_mvn.h silva_mvn.cxx
- auto-compilation.scm
- match.scm
- Solution for the copyright processing tool itself: Exclude it from
  the release.  Then it doesn't matter that it's third-party.
- demos/jsripl/vendor
- backend/new_cxx/cmake/Modules/FindGSL.cmake clearly came from the Internet
- backend/new_cxx/valgrind-python.supp was seeded from the Internet, but we modified it
- refman/Makefile is part of a Sphinx distribution, with custom modifications

Find all files in the git tree:
git ls-tree -r --full-tree --name-only HEAD

Find all files in the git tree except Eigen and external/ (which are thrid party)
git ls-tree -r --full-tree --name-only HEAD | \
  grep -v "^backend/new_cxx/inc/Eigen/" | \
  grep -v "^external/"

Compute all file extensions in the git tree (except Eigen and external/)
git ls-tree -r --full-tree --name-only HEAD | \
  grep -v "^backend/new_cxx/inc/Eigen/" | \
  grep -v "^external/" | \
  while read line; do case $line in *.*) ;; *) continue;; esac; echo "${line##*.}"; done | \
  sort -u 

Find all extensionless files in the git tree except Eigen and external/
git ls-tree -r --full-tree --name-only HEAD | \
  grep -v "^backend/new_cxx/inc/Eigen/" | \
  grep -v "^external/" | \
  while read line; do case $line in *.*) continue ;; esac; echo "$line"; done

Detect all instances of a particular extension
git ls-tree -r --full-tree --name-only HEAD | \
  grep -v "^backend/new_cxx/inc/Eigen/" | \
  grep -v "^external/" | \
  grep "\.ipy$"

Compute all committers to a repository
git log --all --pretty=short | grep "Author:" | sort -u
