# Rationale: Suppressing no-member and no-name-in-module errors
#   Pylint does not understand metaprogramming.  Sadly, much of
#   visible interface of numpy and scipy appears to be metaprogrammed
#   (for instance, by structured re-import from submodules), so every
#   attempt to use those tools produces huge numbers of Pylint
#   problems.

# Rationale: Wildcard imports
#   Turns out wildcard imports in Python import every name visible in
#   the imported module, including ones it itself imported.  Import
#   chains like that are confusing disasters waiting to happen.

# Rationale: Permit defining attributes outside init
#   We just have too much code that relies upon being able to store
#   arbitrary stuff in an object.

# Rationale: Permit redefining builtin names
#   id especially is just too useful a name to surrender to the
#   useless builtin it names.

# Rationale: Suppressing design-nanny warnings
#   Yes, methods with too many arguments, local variables, and
#   branches are poor design; but that is something that should bother
#   people even without Pylint getting in their face about it; and
#   doing the refactorings to clean that up requires more taste than
#   can be produced under pressure.
#   TODO Perhaps turn C0302, R0902, R0911, R0912, R0913, R0914, R0915 back on
#   for the code-review-mode style check
